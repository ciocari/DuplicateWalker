## Synopsis

This aims to be a Gemini (http://macpaw.com/gemini) clone. Finds duplicate files in the 
directory provided by the user. It compares the files using chunks to 
speed up the comparison process.

## Status

Project unfinished.

- Comparison algorithm is done. Missing testing for special file types (links, etc).
- Missing the GUI stuff. For now it is just a CLI tool.
